# Python Class Design and Polymorphism Challenge üêç

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to two assignments that demonstrate Python concepts:

1. **Class Design**: Creating a `Smartphone` class and a derived class `GamingSmartphone`.
2. **Polymorphism Challenge**: Demonstrating polymorphism with an `Animal` class and its subclasses.
